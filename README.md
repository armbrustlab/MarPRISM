MarPRISM: Marine PRotist In-Situ trophic Mode predictor

Model was updated/changed from https://github.com/armbrustlab/trophic-mode-ml

To examine the in situ activity of protists, Lambert et al., 2022 (https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2100916119, https://github.com/armbrustlab/trophic-mode-ml) developed a machine learning model to predict the trophic mode of marine protist species based on gene expression from metatranscriptomes. 

Recent studies ([Groussman et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04005-5); [Lasek-Nesselquist and Johnson, 2019](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/11/11/3218/5610072); [Van Vlierberghe et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13104-021-05717-2)) identified that a number of the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project ([MMETSP](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001889)) transcriptomes used for training the model have a low number of sequences and/or high contamination.
