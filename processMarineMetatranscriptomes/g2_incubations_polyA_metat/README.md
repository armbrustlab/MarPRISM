## **Scripts for processing polyA-selected metatranscriptomes collected from Gradients 2 (G2) incubations** 

**aka resource ratio (RR) experiments**

**G2.RR_exp.metadata.csv**: Metadata for G2 incubations

**G2PA.RR_DCM.mf_lookup.csv**: sample ID (Inv_ID) to sequence run ID (NWGC_ID)

**G2PA.RR_DCM.process_short_reads.sh**: trim adapters and quality trim raw sequence reads from G2 incubations

**G2RR_polyA_kallisto**: map trimmed sequence reads from G2 incubations to G2 surface assembly
